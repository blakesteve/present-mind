    <p>I am a psychotherapist, trained and experienced in doing one-on-one therapy with adults (18 years and over). The majority of my previous work focused on serving clients in community mental health &amp; non-profit settings, where I provided affordable services to individuals, whose lives were affected by serious chronic illness, mental health diagnoses, addiction, homelessness, and relational turmoil. Most recently, I have joined the clinical team of an intensive inpatient drug &amp; alcohol treatment program, where I continue to offer my services. One of the biggest rewards of my field is in never-ending opportunities to learn and connect with like-minded professionals. In turn, I am committed to making my practice an experience that inspires learning and fosters capacity to connect.</p>

     <p>My approach to therapy is eclectic. I believe that in addition to personal goals, everyone is working toward achieving balance. The philosophy of my therapeutic approach is based on the notion that self-awareness is a necessary condition for change, no matter what your concerns are. I draw from a number of theoretical bases to foster accurate insight into whatever concerns you bring to therapy. I find it helpful to conceptualize each issue from a variety of angles to help you deepen the understanding and to map out a strategy to address them. Whenever appropriate, I enjoy bringing humor to therapy session. I believe that taking good care of the body is one of the key requirements for supporting a healthy mind. I strive to provide the necessary support for clients to move in this rewarding direction of self-care. I have personal experience negotiating my own cultural identity and enjoy working with individuals who are working to integrate multiple cultural influences into a meaningful and congruent presence. </p>
      <p>To help you make an informed decision, regarding whether or not we are a good fit to do therapy work, I offer two consultations, a 15 minute phone consultation and a 50 minute face-to-face consultation, both free of charge. To schedule your consultation, whether via phone or face-to-face, please call <strong>(512) 655-9574</strong> or email <strong><a class="green-link" href="mailto:ea@presentmindcounseling.com">ea@presentmindcounseling.com</a></strong>. Please keep in mind that email is not a secure means of communication.</p>
