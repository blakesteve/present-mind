        <h2>What is EMDR?</h2>
        <p id="services-top-paragraph">One of the services I offer is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, better known as EMDR approach. EMDR is an evidence-based approach, supported by extensive research and practiced world-wide to address a variety of conditions. It is most recognized for its effective application in treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It has been designated as an effective treatment by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and others.</p>
        <div class="pull-quote">EMDR has been designated as an effective treatment by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and others.</div>
        <p>During EMDR, the therapist works with the client to identify a specific problem as the focus of the treatment session. The client calls to mind the disturbing issue or event, what was seen, heard, felt, thought, etc., and what thoughts and beliefs are currently held about that event. The therapist facilitates the directional movement of the eyes or other dual attention stimulation of the brain, while the client focuses on the disturbing material, and the client notices whatever comes to mind without making any effort to control direction or content. Each person will process information uniquely, based on personal experiences and values. The therapist continues to facilitate processing until the memory becomes less disturbing and is associated with positive thoughts and beliefs about oneâ€™s self. During EMDR, the client may experience intense emotions, but by the end of the session, most people report a great reduction in the level of disturbance.</p>

        <p>This approach requires an in-depth screening process to ensure that EMDR is appropriate to address your unique situation. It is my duty to ensure thorough screening to determine the complexity of your case and whether any additional referrals are necessary. With EMDR therapy history-taking and assessment make take more than one session. Therefore, it may take several appointments to plan your treatment and provide you with the appropriate referrals, if any are needed. To accommodate for the specific techniques of this approach, EMDR therapy sessions last 80 minutes.</p>
