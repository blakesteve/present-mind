      <h2>Phone and Face-to-face Consultations</h2>
      <p>The decision to begin therapy is not always an easy one.  In attempt to inform your decision beyond of what is available on this website, I offer two consultations, 15 minutes via phone and 50 minutes in-person.  Both consultations are free of charge and present an opportunity for me to answer any questions you might still have about what I can do for you as well as get the basic information about the concerns you hope to address in therapy. If as a result of these consultations, we determine that your needs fall outside the scope of my practice, I will help you find the appropriate provider.</p>
    <p>Once we agree on the date and time for your initial face-to-face appointment, I expect that you keep it. If you do need to reschedule or cancel, I ask that you please let me know at least 72 hours in advance. The length of the session will be 50 minutes. During this session, we will focus on the history of your presenting concerns, discuss your goals and expectations, talk about privacy and confidentiality issues, as well as the nature of therapeutic relationship. I will be taking a lot of notes, and you may as well, to make sure any questions or concerns that arise are addressed. It may take us more than one session to agree on plan what would be the focus of our therapeutic work. If I believe that your concerns are best addressed by a professional in a different field, or if your concern requires expertise other than my own, I will provide you with necessary referrals.</p>
      <p>To schedule your consultation, whether via phone or face-to-face, please call <strong>(512) 655-9574</strong> or email <strong><a class="green-link" href="mailto:ea@presentmindcounseling.com">ea@presentmindcounseling.com</a></strong>. Please keep in mind that email is not a secure means of communication.</p>
