    <h1>What is therapy?</h1>
    <p class="vision-first">Therapy, in any form, is the intentional movement toward self-awareness. To approach the mind with curiosity and despite fear is to identify yourself as a conscious and intending witness to your own being. To embrace this curiosity is to welcome an unabridged and unedited self, and to allow this force to transform false motivations, automatic thinking, painful emotions, and destructive behaviors: to create a life without unnecessary suffering. Therapy is a process of charting and integrating the self, creating a space of clarity, working towards a cognizant acceptance of freedom and responsibility to cultivate a mindful presence in your own life and the world.</p>
    <p>For some, seeking therapy is an obvious decision, while others may spend a good while at the threshold, hesitant to acknowledge that help is needed. Yet, others may view outside help as defeat, a confirmation that they did not have the personal resources to address their concerns. In reality, a life worth living is full of struggles, which at times can overwhelm, stifle, and discourage. There are many reasons to come to therapy. Whether it is for improving specific symptoms, addressing relationship concerns, achieving balance, or personal growth, therapy is a recognized and effective means to work toward most unique goals.</p>
    <p>We are wired to connect. In fact, the majority of life events take place within this interpersonal space that inspires, shapes, and guides our most meaningful experiences. No wonder, we invest so much into building and nurturing these connections. In therapy, the relationship between you and the therapist is of equal importance. Time and again, research demonstrates that the quality of the therapeutic alliance, the therapist-client relationship, is of primary importance when it comes to predicting successful outcomes. I recognize that coming to therapy takes courage and developing trust can be a reluctant endeavor. It is my goal to provide you with safe space and sufficient time to work at a comfortable pace.</p>
    <p>On a larger scale, my work is guided by the belief that we are many parts of a single entity. It is my vision that individual insight fosters connections that nurture and inspire to create a better world.</p>
