      <h2>Fees</h2>
      <p>Your inititial 15 minute phone consultation as well as the 50 minute face-to-face consultation are free.</p>
      <p>Following your free consultations, you have a number of options to cover therapy fees: private pay, in-network insurance coverage, and out-of-network insurance coverage.</p>
      <p>Therapy services vary in price from $100.00 to $130.00 for private pay clients, depending on the length of the session. Longer sessions are usually reserved for clients coming in for EMDR therapy.</p>
      <p>For clients who prefer to use their insurance, the fees are set according to the fee schedules set forth by their insurance companies. I currently accept the following insurance plans: BlueCross BlueShield of Texas and Cigna.</p>
      <p>If you are covered under other health plans, you may still use your insurance to pay for my services as an out&ndash;of&ndash;network provider. Please, verify with your health insurance provider which services will be covered and at what rate.</p>
      <p>To make an informed decision regarding how to pay for therapy, keep in mind that there are pros and cons to using your insurance to cover psychotherapy services. Information regarding the benefits and drawbacks of using your insurance to access mental health services is widely available for you to review and consider. You are always welcome to address any concerns you may have during your consultation.</p>
      <p>All payments are due at the time of each individual session. You can get more information regarding the fee procedures in the Client Brochure, located in the &lsquo;Forms&rsquo; section of this website. If you have any questions, you will have an opportunity to address these during your initial phone consultation.</p>
      <h2>Scheduling</h2>
      <p>Finding time for therapy is not always easy. However, when deciding on when to come to therapy, consider factors beyond schedule convenience. For therapy to be effective, you must be aware and engaged throughout the entire session. Keep in mind that during your session some distressing material may come to light. It is not advisable to schedule any important engagements for time immediately following a therapy session, as insight is likely to involve processing that extends well beyond the hour.</p>
      <p>Your initial appointment will be scheduled at the time of your phone consultation. In addition to daytime hours, I offer early morning and late evening appointments.</p>
